## Original Story

When you hear the word "Homelab", does it sound a bit intimidating? Like something only super-gurus do in a secret lab? Well, that's not true at all! Don't worry, it's way simpler than you think! Ahhhhh, please DOOOOO NOTTTT close this page, I promise I'm not joking!!!

Even though I'm a software engineering student, I can promise you this isn't some "professional" job. It's more like building a digital Lego castle. Honestly, if you can sign up for a GitHub account by yourself, you've already got all the magic spells you need for this adventure.

My secret weapon in this adventure is Docker. Don't think of it as some scary tech thing, it's more like a super-helpful little partner that keeps everything neat and tidy. I'll write a whole post dedicated to this cutie later~

Soooo, how did I fall down this wonderful rabbit hole of self-hosting? It all started during my amazing gap year(actually two years lol), which gave me the perfect little corner to dream and tinker.

Back then, I was basically glued to online tech stores, "window shopping" and daydreaming about the parts I'd need for my perfect little server. And of course, I had a little wishlist all ready!

- I needed a Minecraft server to play with my friends, so it required a CPU with a little bit of punch.
- I wanted to run a bunch of services, like my own Git service, Nextcloud for my files, and Jellyfin to watch TV and movies.
- I needed tons of space for all my media and personal treasures, so I aimed for at least 10TB.

I'll admit, my "all-in-one" strategy of stuffing everything into one box isn't exactly best practice, since it doesn't separate storage from computing. But! I learned so much and had double the fun, and isn't that what matters? I just have to pray it doesn't go "All-in-Boom" one day, haha.

What's the next step? To share my building blocks and how much they cost, of course!

## My Building Blocks

> Here's the recipe for my little server and what it cost (in CAD). Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own!~

| Type | Brand | Note | Price |
| - | - | - | - |
| NVME SSD | Lexar | 4T*2 | ~$270*2 = $540 |
| NVME SSD | Fanxiang | 2T | ~$140 |
| CPU | Intel | 13400 | ~$158 |
| Motherboard | Maxsun | Z790 | ~$260 |
| Memory | Glowy | 16G*2 | ~$120 |
| Memory | Kingbank | 16G*2 | ~$140 |
| Cooler | Thermalright | AXP90X53 | ~$30 |
| Power Supply | Seasonic | SUG300 | ~$100 |
| Computer Case | N/A | N/A | ~$40 |

> A little sticky note for myself (and for you!): This Fanxiang NVME SSD is a bit... moody. It's not the most stable. My plan is to swap it out for a reliable Samsung before 2027. You can learn from my little stumble ~(´-ω-)`~

### A few friendly tips

1. Always figure out what you want to do with your server before you buy any shiny new toys.
2. Your motherboard and CPU are best friends, they have to get along! It's usually best to pick your CPU first, then find a motherboard that loves it. (But you can do it the other way around if you find a board you totally fall in love with!)
3. DDR5 memory can be a bit of a diva sometimes. My little server had a few tantrums and reset its BIOS because of memory frequency issues. Try to buy RAM that's been officially tested and approved by your motherboard's maker.
4. Get a good, reliable power supply. This is your server's heart! Since it runs 24/7, you definitely don't want to cheap out here.
5. You could use HDD for tons of space, but I'm super sensitive to their "click-clack" singing, so, that's a choice you'll have to make.

What's next? That's a wrap for today! The hardware is the first level of this game. Once you clear it, the next spell will reveal itself in this powerful magic book~
