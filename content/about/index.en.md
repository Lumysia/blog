## About Me

Hey there, I'm Livia! Welcome to "Lumysia's Grimoire," my cozy corner of the internet.

I recently moved to Oshawa, Canada, to pursue a Master's degree in Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University.

This blog is my space to share stories and reflections on:

- My life.
- Future adventures in maintaining a homelab server and development software.
- Daily thoughts and other interesting stories.

Welcome to my new mind home.
