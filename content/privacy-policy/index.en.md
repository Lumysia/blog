We use third-party services on our website. We do not control these third parties, and their privacy policies govern their use of your information.

Your comment, along with your public GitHub profile information (such as your username and avatar), will be publicly visible. We do not store this information on our servers. Your interaction with the comment system is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

We use a cookie consent banner to manage your consent. Third-party services like Google Analytics may also place cookies on your browser to perform their services. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but note that some parts of the website may not function properly without them.

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.
