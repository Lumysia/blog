## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Lumysia's Grimoire ("we", "us", "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.

## 2. Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information from our visitors. This is a static website built with Hugo, and we do not use any tracking technologies, cookies, or server-side analytics that would identify you personally. Your visit to this website is completely anonymous.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We use third-party services on our website. We do not control these third parties, and their privacy policies govern their use of your information.

- **Giscus (for Comments):** Our comment system is powered by Giscus, which utilizes GitHub Discussions. When you leave a comment, you authenticate with your GitHub account. Your comment, along with your public GitHub profile information (such as your username and avatar), will be publicly visible. We do not store this information on our servers. Your interaction with the comment system is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

- **Cloudflare:** We use Cloudflare to enhance the security and performance of our website. Cloudflare's services are essential for protecting our site against malicious activities and for optimizing content delivery. As a result, certain data, such as your IP address and other device information, may be processed by Cloudflare when you access our website. This information is handled in accordance with Cloudflare's privacy policy.
You can learn more about how Cloudflare handles data by reviewing their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## 4. Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use a cookie consent banner to manage your consent. Third-party services like Google Analytics may also place cookies on your browser to perform their services. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but note that some parts of the website may not function properly without them.

Our website, being a static site, does not directly use or set any cookies for tracking or analytical purposes. However, third-party services that we use, such as Cloudflare, may set cookies that are strictly necessary for the security and functionality of the site. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information and are essential for protecting our site from malicious traffic. You can manage or disable cookies through your web browser's settings, but please be aware that doing so may affect the functionality or security of this website.

## 5. Data Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 6. Children's Privacy

This website is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of our updates.
