## Next Stop, Oshawa

Hey there, I'm Livia! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I've just landed in Canada, and this is definitely a new chapter of my life, loading in real-time.

Right now, I'm a Software Engineering Master's student at Ontario Tech University, trying to survive a program that I'm pretty sure is designed to be ridiculously difficult. So, this blog will be my space to share all the little things—random thoughts from my daily life here, stories of me wrestling with code, and everything in between. It's a casual space for anyone who loves a cozy story.

I've decided to write like a small turtle: slowlyyyyy writing, and slowlyyyyy thinking. Updates might be... well, turtle-paced, but I promise each one will be thoughtfully crafted, straight from my heart.

This is actually my third attempt at starting a blog. Third time's the charm, right? I'm hoping this little turtle can crawl a bit further this time! In the future, you can expect to see posts about coding, my adventures in maintaining a homelab server, and any other interesting stories I stumble upon.

Just so you know, this is a static website hosted on Github and Cloudflare, and I'll be sharing all the source code right here: [Lumysia/blog - Github](https://github.com/Lumysia/blog). Please be nice to my little digital home! No funny business, okay? (´• ω •`)♡

Oshawa's clear sky today reminded me of the same beautiful sky back in Kunming. The view is the same, but the girl looking at it is different. I'll admit, there's a part of me still trying to untangle knots from the past... but that's okay. We all move at our own pace.

So, here it is—my very first post.

Welcome to my new mind home.
